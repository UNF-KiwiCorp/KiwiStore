**🥝 KiwiStore: A Unique Collectible Marketplace** 

KiwiStore is a web-based application developed by a team of creators. While similar in concept to the popular platform Mercari, KiwiStore offers a distinctive feature - its own proprietary collectible grading system called KiwiScore.

**🥝 Collectible Grading with KiwiScore**

The KiwiScore system is designed to provide buyers and sellers with a standardized way to assess the condition and value of collectible items listed on the platform. This custom grading scale aims to bring more transparency and confidence to transactions, allowing users to make informed decisions when purchasing rare or valuable collectibles.

**🥝 Connecting Collectors and Enthusiasts**

Like Mercari, KiwiStore serves as a marketplace where individuals can buy, sell, and trade a wide variety of collectible items. Whether you're a seasoned collector or a newcomer to the world of collectibles, KiwiStore offers a user-friendly platform to explore, discover, and acquire unique and hard-to-find items.

**🥝 Future Implementation**

It is important to note that the KiwiScore system is not currently implemented in this version of the project. However, if the project were to go live, the integration of the KiwiScore system would be a key feature, further enhancing the platform's ability to facilitate secure and reliable transactions for collectible enthusiasts.
